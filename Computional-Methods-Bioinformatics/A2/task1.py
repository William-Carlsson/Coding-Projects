This program identifies the sequence of alpha-carbon atoms in a molecular chain 
based on their 3D coordinates. The solution is implemented as follows:

1. Reading Coordinates:
   - The `read_coordinates` function reads atomic coordinates from a specified input file.
     Each line in the file contains an atom's serial number and its 3D coordinates (x, y, z).

2. Calculating Distances:
   - The `calculate_distance` function computes the Euclidean distance between two atoms 
     using their 3D coordinates.

3. Building Adjacency Based on Distance:
   - The `find_alpha_chain` function identifies neighboring atoms in the chain 
     based on a fixed alpha-carbon distance of approximately 3.8 Ã… (with a tolerance).
   - It constructs an adjacency list where each atom is linked to its neighbors.

4. Sorting Neighbors:
   - To ensure consistent traversal, the neighbors of each atom in the adjacency list 
     are sorted by increasing distance.

5. Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal:
   - Starting from a specific atom (atom 8, at index 7), the program performs a DFS 
     to traverse the chain. This ensures that all atoms in the chain are visited in sequence.

6. Chain Construction:
   - The serial numbers of the atoms are recorded in the order they are visited during the DFS.

7. Execution and Output:
   - The `main` function specifies the input file, runs the algorithm, and prints the 
     total number of alpha-carbon atoms in the chain and their sequence.

How to run:
- Execute the script using `python task1.py`.
- Modify the `input_file` variable in the `main` function to specify the input file.
