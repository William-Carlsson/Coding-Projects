Data Parsing:
- The program reads the PDB file, focusing on MODEL and ENDMDL records to separate different protein models.
- Within each model, only alpha-carbon atom coordinates (identified by ATOM records with "CA") are extracted.

Internal Distance Computation:
- For each model, the program calculates all pairwise distances between alpha-carbon atoms, resulting in a symmetric distance matrix for each model.

Model Comparison:
- Models are compared using the sum of squared errors (SSE) of corresponding pairwise distances.

Clustering:
- Pairwise SSE values are calculated for all combinations of models.
- The program identifies the pairs of models with the highest and lowest SSE, representing the most and least structurally similar pairs, respectively.

Output:
- The program outputs the pairs of models with the maximum and minimum SSE and the corresponding SSE values.
